Welcome to the AI Agent repository! This project leverages the power of LangGraph to build a multi-functional AI agent capable of efficiently retrieving information from three specialized sources: ArXiv, Tavily Search for general web search, and Wikipedia.
Project Overview

This repository provides an AI agent that uses an intelligent routing system to determine the best tool for the query at hand. Based on the nature of the input query, the agent dynamically selects from one of three available tools to retrieve accurate and relevant information:

  - ArXiv Search: For accessing academic papers and research materials in various scientific fields.
  - Tavily Search: A web search tool tailored for more general information and browsing needs.
  - Wikipedia Search: A resource for quick, factual information and general knowledge queries.

By combining these three distinct tools, the AI agent can efficiently answer a wide range of questions, from deep academic topics to general knowledge inquiries, with optimized response accuracy.
